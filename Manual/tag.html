<p>Tag is an editor-independent plain text file indexing format that is used to establish connections between multiple files and items. This is done so by referencing one Tag item inside another in a Tag file. Tag files end with the <samp class="file">.tag</samp> extension.
</p>
<p>Tag is largely inspired by late German sociologist Niklas Luhmann&rsquo;s <i class="i">Zettelkasten</i> method.

<p>Tag is an indexing format. This means Tag stores the list of all the files and items of your interest along with their titles, relationships, and what to make of them. Imagine the file system your computer is your kitchen cabinet. The files on your computer are foods and ingredients disorderly placed on the cabinet. Then tag is a personal reference book where you keep track of all the items on your cabinet by giving them an unique identifier along with where they are located on the cabinet, what you can do with them, and how one is related to another. By keeping a list of all your items in such manner defines the structure of your project/directory and streamlines your workflow. Here&rsquo;s an example Tag file:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@1.8 | Platypus  | #animals #land  | :src: platypus.txt
@1.9 | Octopus   | #animals #ocean | :src: octopus.txt
@2.9 | Creatures | #animals | :ref: @1.8 @1.9 | :src: crit.txt
@3.3 | Tentacles | #animals | :ref: @1.8 | :src: tentacles.txt
</pre></div>

<p>Here, each items are separate by new lines. All the items are sorted by their unique identifier, tag number. This is important as it makes item search much easier. The components of each items are separated by the pipe (<kbd class="kbd">|</kbd>) symbol. The first component of any item has to be its identifier i.e. the tag number. Tag number is the only mandatory component of any Tag item. The component followed by the tag number in the example is the title of the item. Like every other component other than the tag number, it is optional. The component followed by the title in the example is the flag list. These are used for labels and categorization. Lastly, the <code class="code">:src:</code> property refers to the path to the content of the item i.e. its source and the <code class="code">:ref:</code> is the list of all the other items the current item references. The components of an item shouldn&rsquo;t be broken down into multiple lines. And, neither should multiple items be declared in one line. Having one line per item keeps everything neatly organized.

<h3 class="section" id="How-Tag-Numbering-works-1"><span>1.2 How Tag Numbering works<a class="copiable-link" href="#How-Tag-Numbering-works-1"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Tag marks, sorts, and identifies items with alphanumeric floating point numbers. This makes item look-up and referencing a lot easier. For example, let&rsquo;s say we have four items with the tags &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.0, @2.0, @3.0, @4.0</samp>&rsquo;:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@1.0
@2.0
@3.0
@4.0
</pre></div>

<p>And, we want to insert a new item after &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.0</samp>&rsquo; but we don&rsquo;t want to change the tag number of the old items. What we do here is tag the new item a number between &lsquo;<samp class="samp">1.0</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">2.0</samp>&rsquo; and then insert the new item. &lsquo;<samp class="samp">1.1</samp>&rsquo; will suffice here. So, the five sections are &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.0, @1.1, @2.0, @3.0, @4.0</samp>&rsquo; where the new &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.1</samp>&rsquo; is between &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.0</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@2.0</samp>&rsquo;:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@1.0
@1.1 &lt;-- the newly inserted item
@2.0
@3.0
@4.0
</pre></div>

<p>The tag number of an item is permanent. We need permanent identification number so we can easily reference items and not worry about it ever changing.
</p>
<p>Note that a tag can be any positive number that isn&rsquo;t already taken by another item. The tag for the new item could have been any number between &lsquo;<samp class="samp">1.0</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">2.0</samp>&rsquo; such as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.01</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.5</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.9</samp>&rsquo;, etc. We have infinite possibilities to choose from.

<h3 class="section" id="Valid-Tag-numbers-1"><span>1.3 Valid Tag numbers<a class="copiable-link" href="#Valid-Tag-numbers-1"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Tag numbers are positive alphanumeric floating-point numbers consisting of Latin letters and Arabic numerals that are used identifiers for tag items. Tag numbers are represented with an &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@</samp>&rsquo; followed by the number. For example, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.0</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.1</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.19</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@1.B2</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@12.5</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@786.25</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@300000000.59</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@0.0000000001</samp>&rsquo; are all valid tag numbers. The radix-point character (<kbd class="kbd">.</kbd>) is used to separate the whole number from the fraction.
</p>
<p>The tag number is alphanumeric which means the tag number is made out of both the numbers <kbd class="kbd">0</kbd> through <kbd class="kbd">9</kbd> and the letters <kbd class="kbd">A</kbd> through <kbd class="kbd">Z</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd">a</kbd> through <kbd class="kbd">z</kbd>. After <kbd class="kbd">9</kbd> comes <kbd class="kbd">A</kbd>. This is base 62 numeral system. This is chosen so we can express more tags with fewer digits and create more meaningful tag numbers. All the digits in base 62 numeral system in ascending order:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
</pre>
<p>There a few rules to choosing a tag numbers:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>A tag number cannot contain anything other than:

<ul class="itemize mark-minus">
<li>one <kbd class="kbd">@</kbd> in the beginning

</li><li>alphanumeric characters

</li><li>radix point (<kbd class="kbd">.</kbd>)
</li></ul>

</li><li>The number must be unique. No two items with the same tag number.

</li><li>The number must be greater than zero. &lsquo;<samp class="samp">@0.0</samp>&rsquo; is not a valid tag number.

</li><li>The number must be greater than previous item&rsquo;s and smaller than next item&rsquo;s.
</li></ul>

<p>A tag number under the hood is implemented with a string mantissa and an integer exponent. This custom data type is chosen over float/double for range and precision.

<p>Tag items are the single units in Tag files. Tag items are defined in one line and may have multiple components separated by the pipe (<kbd class="kbd">|</kbd>) symbol. A tag item must start with its tag number component, followed by the title component if it exists; the order of rest of the components does not matter.

<p>An item in Tag can be given a title. They should be placed right after the tag number. Example of items with titles:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@1.0 | The First Item
@2.0 | Second Item
@2.5 | The Item After Second Item
@3.0 | The Last Item?
</pre></div>

<p>Titles are sort of special components as they don&rsquo;t have property key and they aren&rsquo;t really flags.

<div class="section-level-extent" id="Item-Flags">

</div>
<h3 class="section" id="Item-Flags-1"><span>2.2 Item Flags<a class="copiable-link" href="#Item-Flags-1"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Flags are words or labels used to convey the quality or features of a Tag item. They must start with the hash (<kbd class="kbd">#</kbd>) symbol followed by the name of the flag. Flags are boolean variables meaning an item either has a specific flag or it does not. They are case-sensitive and multiple of them can reside inside the same component. Flags can be used to label and categorize items:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@b.83 | &quot;The Raft&quot; by Stephen King   | #books #horror
@b.98 | &quot;Red Rising&quot; by Pierce Brown | #books #dystopian
@c.21 | Brother (1997)               | #cinema #crime #drama
@c.a5 | Seven Samurai (1954)         | #cinema #drama
</pre></div>

<p>Some flags have special meaning to the Tag system. For example, an item can have the <code class="code">#ARCHIVED</code> flag indicates it is now archived and will be ignored by the compiler:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@3.75 | #ARCHIVED
</pre></div>

<p>Todo flags can be used to turn an item into a todo item. <code class="code">#TODO</code> and <code class="code">#DONE</code> are the two basic todo states but more can be used and configured. Examples of items with todo flags:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@td.01 | Finish Reading about Flags    | #TODO
@td.02 | Write about Biggest Overcomes | #DONE
@td.31 | Share Tag with others         | #TODO #IMPORTANT

</div>
<h3 class="section" id="Item-Properties-1"><span>2.3 Item Properties<a class="copiable-link" href="#Item-Properties-1"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>Items in Tag can be given named properties. Properties are key-value pairs. The key of the property need to be enclosed inside colon (<kbd class="kbd">:</kbd>) symbols and it should be followed by the value, like &lsquo;<samp class="samp">:<var class="var">key</var>: <var class="var">value</var></samp>&rsquo;. Properties can be used to denote named information regarding an item:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@c.35 | Scarface (1983)           | :director: Brian De Palma | :rating: 4.1

@c.42 | Memories of Murder (2003) | :director: Bong Joon Ho   | :rating: 4.4
</pre></div>

<p>Properties can be used to establishs connection between multiple items in a Tag document:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@3.24 | Life of an Octopus
@3.9o | Living in a Garden
@3.98 | Octupus's Garden? | :ref: @3.24 @3.9o

<p>Using appropriate properties, a file can be linked to a tag item. The <code class="code">:src:</code> property is used to link the source (content) of an item. For example, a tag item that has its content stored in <samp class="file">contents.txt</samp>:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@1.0 | I Have Contents! | :src: contents.txt
</pre></div>

<p><samp class="file">contents.txt</samp>:
</p>
<div class="example user-txt">
<pre class="example-preformatted">I am the contents of @1.0. Please think of me
as contents inside that item.
</pre></div>

<p>We can also denote the output file. For example, using property <code class="code">:obj:</code> we can declare the desired object path for our C code:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">
<pre class="example-preformatted">@3.0 | My C Code | :sh: cc -c -o $:obj: $:src: | :obj: code.o | :src: code.c
</pre></div>

<p>That value given with the <code class="code">:sh:</code> (shell command) property will translate to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">cc -c -o code.o code.c</samp>&rsquo;. Running that tag item will compile <samp class="file">code.c</samp> into <samp class="file">code.o</samp>.

Butterflies are flying insects from the Lepidoptera
superfamily. Moleculars evidences suggests that
butterflies may have originated in the Cretaceous period.

Jurassic period was 201 and 145 million years ago.
So, unless there's new evidence, butterflies probably
didn't exist during the Jurassic period.

<p>Tag supports timestamps to satisfy the need for date and time representation. Timestamps can be used for tracking time, scheduling todo items, etc. To denote a certain period in time, tag has time period and to denote a duration of time, tag has time duration.
</p>
<p>Tag supports ISO 8601 format for representing time. Timestamps and durations in Tag should be enclosed inside angle bracket (<kbd class="kbd">&lt;&gt;</kbd>) symbols.

<p>ISO 8601, maintained by the International Organization for Standardization, is an international standard for time-related data. ISO 8601 timestamp format is ordered from largest to smallest unit of time, padded with leading zeros, uses hyphen and colons as unit separators, supports timezone, and is in 24-hour format. ISO 8601 supports multiple formats for representing time but commonly <code class="code">&lt;<var class="var">yyyy</var>-<var class="var">mm</var>-<var class="var">dd</var>&gt;</code> is used for just date and <code class="code">&lt;<var class="var">yyyy</var>-<var class="var">mm</var>-<var class="var">dd</var>T<var class="var">hh</var>:<var class="var">mm</var>&gt;</code> is used for date and time.

<p>Dates are most easily represented with the year-month-day format. For example, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-05-07&gt;</samp>&rsquo;. The units are separated with hyphen (<kbd class="kbd">-</kbd>) symbol. Each unit has a fixed number of digits and must be padded with leading zeros. You may drop the month day to represent just a year and a month. For example, to represent May 2025 you could use &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-05&gt;</samp>&rsquo; and to represent just the year 2025 use &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025&gt;</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Dates can also be represented with week numbers. The format is <code class="code">&lt;<var class="var">YYYY</var>-W<var class="var">ww</var>-<var class="var">D</var>&gt;</code> where <var class="var">YYYY</var> represents ISO week-numbering year, <var class="var">ww</var> represents the week number from &lsquo;<samp class="samp">W01</samp>&rsquo; to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">W53</samp>&rsquo; of the year, and <var class="var">D</var> represents the weekday number from &lsquo;<samp class="samp">1</samp>&rsquo; (Monday) to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">7</samp>&rsquo; (Sunday). For example, Wednesday 19th week of the year 2025 is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">2025-W19-3</samp>&rsquo;. The weekday number can be ignored to represent a week of a year. So, 19th week of the year 2025 is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">2025-W19</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Use ordinal date to represent date with days since the start of the year. The format is <code class="code"><var class="var">yyyy</var>-<var class="var">DDD</var></code> where <var class="var">yyyy</var> represents a year and <var class="var">DDD</var> represents the day of the year. For example, 127th day of the year 2025 is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">2025-127</samp>&rsquo;. This will not create ambiguity with year-month since month numbers have two digits and day of the year numbers have three.

<p>Times in ISO 8601 are represented with hours, minutes, and seconds. The units are separated by colon (<kbd class="kbd">:</kbd>) symbol. The format is <code class="code">&lt;<var class="var">hh</var>:<var class="var">mm</var>:<var class="var">ss</var>&gt;</code> for hour, minute, and time and <code class="code">&lt;<var class="var">hh</var>:<var class="var">mm</var>&gt;</code> for just hour and minute. The units have fixed number of digits and must be padded with leading zeros.
</p>
<p>To combine date and time the delimeter <kbd class="kbd">T</kbd> must be used. For example &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-05-07T18:00&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-W03-3T03:00&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-120T12:34:33&gt;</samp>&rsquo; are valid ISO 8601 timestamps with both date and time.

<p>Without the time zone designator, ISO 8601 is assumed to be in local time. This is dangerous if the time information is communicated between people from different time zones or if the person using the document ever moves to a place with different time zone. A time offset should be appended to the timestamp to specify the time zone. The format will be <code class="code">&lt;<var class="var">date</var>T<var class="var">time</var><var class="var">Â±</var><var class="var">hh:mm</var>&gt;</code> where <var class="var">date</var> and <var class="var">time</var> refers to the timestamps&rsquo;s date and time respectively and <var class="var">Â±hh:mm</var> refers to the timez one offset. The offset must be given either a plus (<kbd class="kbd">+</kbd>) or minus (<kbd class="kbd">-</kbd>) symbol proceeded by the offset time. A negative offset (minus) means the timez one is behind the UTC and a postive offset means it&rsquo;s ahead of UTC.
</p>
<p>The time zone offset for New York is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-05:00</samp>&rsquo; so to describe 10:30 in the morning of 9th May of 2025 in New York, you&rsquo;d write &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-05-09T10:30-05:00&gt;</samp>&rsquo;. On the other end of the world, if you want to describe 21:30 of 9th May of 2025 in Bangladesh, you&rsquo;d write &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-05-09T21:30+06:00&gt;</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>If the time is in UTC (same as &lsquo;<samp class="samp">+00:00</samp>&rsquo;), you can replace the timezone offset with <kbd class="kbd">Z</kbd>. For example, 15:30 of 9th May of 2025 in UTC is &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-05-09T15:30Z&gt;</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>If you prefer not to clutter your timestamps with extra information, you could use the <code class="code">:TZ:</code> document property. This offset you provide there will be used by all the timestamps with missing offset. Example usage:
</p>
<div class="example user-tag">

<p>Durations or time periods define a length of time. They can be used to denote duration of a todo item, how long an event is supposed to take, the end time given the begin time (or vice versa) of an interval, etc. Time periods in ISO 8601 are represented with the letter <kbd class="kbd">P</kbd> (meaning period) followed by the number and element pairs. For example, 1 year is represented with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;P1Y&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, 7 months and 2 days is represented with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;P7M2D&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, 12 minutes and 30 seconds is represented with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;PT12M30S&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, and 2 days and 12 hours is represented with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;P2DT12H&gt;</samp>&rsquo;. The letter <kbd class="kbd">T</kbd> is a time designator that is placed before the time components to reduce ambiguity with month and minute components. All the period designators in order:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">P (mandatory period indicator)
Y (year)
M (month)
W (week)
D (day)
T (time designator)
H (hour)
M (minute)
S (second)
</pre>
<p>Note that &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;P1M&gt;</samp>&rsquo; means a period of one month. How many days are in that month depends on the context. If you wish to represent a period of 30 days use &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;P30D&gt;</samp>&rsquo; instead.

<p>Repetition in time can be represented in ISO 8601 with repeating intervals.

The letter <kbd class="kbd">R</kbd> is used to denote repeating interval. It is followed by the number <var class="var">n</var> to express the number of repitition. The <var class="var">start</var> time is the start of the repition. The <var class="var">duration</var> period is the duration between each repitition. For example, an event that starts on 19th May of 2025 and occur every week for 5 weeks, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;R5/2025-05-19/P1W&gt;</samp>&rsquo;. This is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-05-19&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-05-26&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-06-02&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-06-09&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;2025-06-16&gt;</samp>&rsquo; all together.
</p>
<p>The number of repitition <var class="var">n</var> can be left out or specied a value of <kbd class="kbd">-1</kbd> to express a repeating interval with indefinite number of repitition. The value <kbd class="kbd">0</kbd> will mean the interval will not repeat at all.

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&rsquo;s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available
DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and
JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&rsquo;s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>The &ldquo;publisher&rdquo; means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.
</p>
<p>A section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;.)  To &ldquo;Preserve the Title&rdquo;
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section &ldquo;Entitled XYZ&rdquo; according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
</li><li> VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
</li><li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document&rsquo;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
</li><li> MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate" type="A" start="1">
<li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

</li><li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

</li><li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

</li><li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

</li><li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

</li><li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

</li><li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document&rsquo;s license notice.

</li><li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

</li><li> Preserve the section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

</li><li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

</li><li> For any section Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

</li><li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

</li><li> Delete any section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

</li><li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo; or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</li><li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li></ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&rsquo;s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
</li><li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
and any sections Entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all
sections Entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;
</p>
</li><li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
</li><li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document&rsquo;s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
</li><li> TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgements&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;, or &ldquo;History&rdquo;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
</li><li> TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.
</p>
</li><li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a class="uref" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy&rsquo;s public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
</p>
</li><li> RELICENSING

<p>&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC Site&rdquo;) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
&ldquo;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&rdquo; (or &ldquo;MMC&rdquo;) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;CC-BY-SA&rdquo; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incorporate&rdquo; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
</p>
<p>An MMC is &ldquo;eligible for relicensing&rdquo; if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
</p>

<h3 class="heading" id="ADDENDUM_003a-How-to-use-this-License-for-your-documents"><span>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents<a class="copiable-link" href="#ADDENDUM_003a-How-to-use-this-License-for-your-documents"> &para;</a></span></h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">  Copyright (C)  <var class="var">year</var>  <var class="var">your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License''.
</pre></div></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the &ldquo;with&hellip;Texts.&rdquo; line with this:
</p>
<div class="example smallexample">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">    with the Invariant Sections being <var class="var">list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var class="var">list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var class="var">list</var>.
</pre></div></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
